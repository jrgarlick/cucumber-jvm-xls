Feature: Dummy Tests
  This is a test testing test that tests the test testing of our tests

  Scenario: Scenario 1
    Given some opening criteria
      And some altering conditions
      And some more altering conditions
    When an action is performed
      And some other thing happens
    Then this testable outcome should be happening
#      And this horribly awful thing happens
      And this other testable outcome should be happening

  Scenario: Scenario 2
    Given some opening criteria
      And some altering conditions
      And some more altering conditions
